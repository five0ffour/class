Ode to a semi-colon

For want of a semi-colon the property was lost.
For want of a property the selector was lost.
For want of a selector the style was lost.
For want of a style the position was lost.
For want of a position the assignment was lost.
For want of a assignment the hour was lost.
And all for the want of a semi-colon.

-- with apologies to Benjamin Franklin

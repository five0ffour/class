                <img id="biopic" src="assets/images/galarneau.jpg" alt="Michael Galarneau" height="200" width="200">
                <p>I was born in upstate New York as the youngest of five children: one sister and three older
                    brothers. Although we are a bit geographically dispersed now, we are all still very close. I am an
                    identical twin. And to answer your questions: "yes we do look alike", "he is, by three minutes", and "no, we
                    don't feel each other's pain (usually!)." Although I did confuse him with
                    myself once, but that is a story for another day.
                </p>

                <p>I was raised in Connecticut where I met my lovely wife and moved to Dover where we are
                    raising three beautiful kids. We have a small cockapoo named "Cassie" that clocks in at about 115
                    decibels when exicited. I am always fortunate to say that even though it takes hard work, I am
                    blessed to be living the American dream. </p>

                <p>I have a degree in Computer Science from Central Connecticut State University back when the PC was
                    the big technology disrupter, people were trying to figure out what that relational database thing
                    was all about and knowing C/Unix was considered edgy. I programmed embedded systems for factory
                    automation equipment, and moved on to embedded financial calculators for insurance companies. I work for Cigna
                    Healthcare as an Enterprise Architect helping to create an omni-channel experience for our
                    customers. It's another way of saying we're building self service channels and keeping our customer
                    service agents from ever having to sound stupid by being forced to say "Would you read that [mail/email/sms/]
                    to me?" to a caller</p>

                <p>When I have a few minute of spare time, if I'm not chauffering kids or taking care of the house, I
                    enjoy a variety of activities: glamping with family and friends (it used to be winter camping I
                    swear!), hiking, genealogy, video and/or board gaming and quartermaster for a local swim club concession.
                    I sometimes dabble in crafty hobbies such as mailling, ring making and am an enterprising scholar
                    of history.</p>

                <p>I am currently refreshing my techncial skill set with the UNH Full Stack Development Bootcamp. My
                    main motivation is to "keep up with the cool kids" at Cigna since we live in a fast paced ever
                    changing world. It is one leg of a three part technical strategy: full stack, serverless and machine
                    learning. </p>

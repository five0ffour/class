            <p>I was born in upstate New York as the youngest of five children: one sister and three older brothers.
                Although we are a bit geographically dispersed now, we are all still very close. I am an identical
                twin. And to answer your questions: &quotyes we do look alike&quot, &quothe is, by three minutes&quot,
                and &quot no we don't feel each other's pain (usually). &quot Although I did confuse him with myself
                once, but that is a story for another day.
            </p>

            <p>I was raised in Connecticut where I met my lovely wife and moved to Dover where we are
                raising three beautiful kids. I am always fortunate to say that even though it takes hard work, I am
                blessed to be living the American dream. </p>

            <p>I have a degree in Computer Science from Central Connecticut State University back when the PC was the
                disrupter, people were trying to figure out what that relational database thing was all about and
                knowing C/Unix was considered edgy. I programmed embedded systems for factory automation equipment, and
                moved on to embedded financial systems for insurance companies. I work for Cigna Healthcare as an
                Enterprise Architect helping to create an omni-channel experience for our customers. It's another way
                of saying we're building self serivce channels and keeping our customer service agents from ever having
                to sound stupid by being forced to say "Can you read your [mail/email/sms/] to me?" to a caller</p>

            <p>When I have a few minute of spare time when not chauffering kids or taking care of the house, I
                enjoy a variety of activities: glamping with family and friends (it used to be winter camping I
                swear!), hiking, genealogy, video and board gaming. I sometimes dabble in crafty hobbies such as
                mailling, ring making and such.</p>

            <p>I am currently refreshing my techncial skill set with the UNH Full Stack Development Bootcamp. My main
                motivation is to "keep up with the cool kids" at Cigna since we live in a fast paced ever changing
                world. It is one leg of a three part technical strategy: full stack, cloud and big data. </p>

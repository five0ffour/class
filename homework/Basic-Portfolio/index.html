            <p>Our whole universe was in a hot dense state, then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion
                started. Wait... The Earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool. Neanderthals developed tools,
                we
                built a wall (we built the pyramids). Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries, that all
                started
                with the big bang!</p>

            <p>Lady Godiva was a freedom rider, she didn't care if the whole world looked. Joan of Arc with the
                Lord to
                guide her, she was a sister who really cooked. Isadora was the first bra burner, ain't you glad she
                showed up. And when the country was falling apart Betsy Ross got it all sewed up. And then there's
                Maude. That old compromisin', enterprisin', anything but tranquilizing, right-on Maude.</p>

            <p>Moon over Parma, bring my love to me tonight. Guide her to Cleveland, underneath your silvery light.
                We're going bowlin' so don't lose her in Solon. Moon over Parma, tonight!</p>
